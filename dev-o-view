DevOps Tools & Commands
-----------------------
Git Commands     git version 2.37.1(linux)        2.25.1(ubuntu)
------------
Git is a DevOps tool used for source code management. 
It is a free and open-source version control system used to handle small to very large projects efficiently.
Git is used to tracking changes in the source code.

Git hub
GitHub is a code hosting platform for version control and collaboration. 
It lets you and others work together on projects from anywhere. 
This tutorial teaches you GitHub essentials like repositories, branches, commits, and pull requests.

we should keep war file into webapps  

conf file to edit the configuration

bin file to start after changing the configuration
startup.sh to start
shutdown.sh to stop

master and slave

Docker commands         Docker version 1.5-2
---------------
Docker is an open platform for developing, shipping, and running applications. 
Docker enables you to separate your applications from your infrastructure so you can deliver software quickly. 
With Docker, you can manage your infrastructure in the same ways you manage your applications.

Docker hub
Docker Hub is a service provided by Docker for finding and sharing container images with your team.

commands
1.docker pull (app name) to pull image from docker hub	
2.docker images  docker image info
3.docker ps docker container info
4.docker run -itd --name containername -p 8080:80 imagename
-itd interactive terminal detached mode
--name give your container name
-p port number to specify
5.docker exec -it containerid /bin/bash
/bin/bash  working shell
6.docker stop containerid to stop container
7.docker ps -a to show stopped containers
8.docker rm conatanerid 
9.docker rmi imagename to delete images
10.docker rm -f id
11.docker log container id
12.docker inspect container id  (docker activity and process & history)
13.docker info container id (container info)
14.docker top container id (process id)
15.docker stats containerid (cpu utilization & memory utilization)
16.docker tag reponame/imagename
17.docker push reponame/taged imagename
18.docker build -t imagename to build a container
19.docker commit
20.docker save (saved as tar file)
21.docker commit containerid backupimagename
22.docker save -o /root/container.tar/backupname
23.docker load -i container.tar
24.docker prune

ANSIBLE Commands   ansible core version 2.11.12
----------------
Ansible is an open source IT Configuration Management, Deployment &
Orchestration tool. It aims to provide large productivity gains to a wide variety of
automation challenges. This tool is very simple to use yet powerful enough to automate
complex multi-tier IT application environments

Ansible works on Master & Slave concept
Ansible works by push based concept
Ansible is write on Python

Ansible works on ec2 user

1.Adhoc command - to execute only one task
2.Playbook _ to execute multi tasks
3.Role
4.Vault

Important files in Ansible
inventory file - slaves.txt
configuration file  - ansible.cfg

Master machine should based on linux machine for better performance
Slave can be run in a different flavour

pagent - key management tool

adhoc command
1.ansible all -i slaves.txt(inventory file name) -m ping
all - all the slave machines in the inventory file
-i - inventory file
-m - module
ping - it is one of the module in ansible

we can grouping the slave machine [prod] group name

2.ansible prod -i slave.txt(inventory file name) -m ping

3.ansible prod -i slave.txt(inventory file name) -m yum -a "name=httpd state=present" -b
all - all the slave machines in the inventory file
-i - inventory file
-m - module (yum) if your slave in ubuntu go with apt module
-a - attributes
name - apache httpd
state - present (install)
	absent (uninstall)
-b - became as root user

4.ansible prod -i slave.txt(inventory file name) -m service -a "name=httpd state=started" -b
5.ansible all -i slaves.txt -m copy -a "src=./slaves.txt dest=/tmp/slaves.txt"
6.ansible abc -m file -a "dest=/path/usr1/newstate=absent"
(delete command)
7.ansible prod -i slave.txt -m user -a 'name=suresh password=admin123' -b
(new user adding)

Ansible is woring on parallel

code editor - visual code editor

in ansible change permission we should go for 4 digit like chmod 0756
it doesnot support as 3 digit chmod 756.

8.ansible-playbook -i slaves.txt(inventory file name) httpd.yaml(playbook name)

playbooks working with 
Ec2.yaml 	loop.yaml	deployment.yaml	    httpd.yaml
jenkins.yaml	portchange.yaml	

9.ansible-vault encrypt httpd.yaml
10.ansible-vault view httpd.yaml
11.ansible-vault edit httpd.yaml

dry run in ansible    -   ansible-playbook -i slaves.txt loop --syntax-check
Ansible Dry Run or Ansible Check mode feature is to validate your playbook before execution. 
With the Ansible Dry Run feature, you can execute the playbook without having to actually make changes on the server. 
this enables us to see what changes are going to be made when the playbook is run.

TERRFORM Commands   terraform version v1.3.2
-----------------
Terraform is a tool for building, changing and versioning infrastructure safely and efficiently. 
Terraform can manage existing and popular cloud service providers as well as custom in-house solutions. 
Configuration files describe to Terraform the components needed to run a single application or your entire datacenter.

Terraform is an IAC tool, used primarily by DevOps teams to automate various infrastructure tasks. 
The provisioning of cloud resources, for instance, is one of the main use cases of Terraform. It's a cloud-agnostic, 
open-source provisioning tool written in the Go language and created by HashiCorp.

Terraform is a go language
scripts HCL Hashicorp language 

visual code editor --> add plugins --> hashicorp terraform

terraform life cycle
Code --> 
terraform init --> it will intialize the terraform
terraform plan --> it will give us the blueprint
terraform apply --> a new resource will be created
terraform destroy --> it will delete the resources

plan is a blue print

Terraform work as Ec2 user

configure with server   -   aws configure

linux file system for terraform /usr/local/bin 

format of terraform - .tf

terraform plan -out terraformoutputfile.out
